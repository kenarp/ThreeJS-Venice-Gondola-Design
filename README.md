# ThreeJS Design Project - Venice Gondola

This project is built with React, it detects if a user's browser supports WebGL. If WebGL is supported, the content created in ThreeJS will be Real-Time rendered to interactively demonstrate my design. On the other hand, if WebGL is disabled, this app will use KeyShotXR pre-rendered content to show the design.

The Venice Gondola model is built in SolidWorks, optimized in MoI3D and Blender, while the environment of the Venice canal in ThreeJS is generated by the Blocakde Labs Skybox AI.
